## Output data schema

### The output columns from the main catalogue
This is a table of the output columns that can come from the main catalogue for the abell2744 field. If one of these columns does not exist in your output data, or you cannot find a column here, it should be one of the `abmag_` columns, and this is due to the availability of different filters for different fields. 

```{include} main_catalogue_fields_table.md
```

### The output columns from the dense basis catalogue
This is a table of all the output columns that can come from the dense basis catalogue for a field. 

```{include} db_catalogue_fields_table.md
